# StudyBuddy - Zuck's Children

## Specification
The program allows users to find peers and connect with them
for group study. The program creates an account of a user with
personal and preferred information for studying such as study spots
and academic programs. The program recommends other users to study
with and allows a user to chat with matches users.

The technology used is Java.

Challenge's faced include testing and deserialization with chat data.

Features we hope to implement in the future include more ways to personalize 
a user's profile, group chats and a map.

## Core Features

#### Authorization
It is the first page the user will face when the program runs.\
The user can register a new account with a username and a password or sign in with existing account.\
When an account is authorized, the window will be closed and open the main window.

#### Swiper - Matching
The user can see matched profiles and choose to accept or reject other students to be a StudyBuddy.\
The matching is produced by our matching algorithm based on information provided in a profile, for example, one's field of study.\
Once two users accept each other, the program creates a new chat room of the two users.

#### Profile Customization
The users can customize their profile including a pronoun, a year of study, a program, and study style.
The profile is used in the matching algorithm to generate a possible matches for our program's one of the most important feature.

#### Chat
The Chat feature implements the general chatting system of a software. It has a list of chat room and the user can open a chat room
to make a chat with other users.

#### Study Spot
The program uses the algorithm to make a recommendation of study spot in a chat room. It takes account preference of both users in a room.

#### Notification
When there is a new match or a new message, the program creates a notification to notify the user about a new update. Users are able to view all notifications and clear all notifications.
